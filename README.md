## Installation
These scripts use the MATLAB (R) programming language and environment. To begin using these scripts, simply add the files to the MATLAB path using the "Set Path" dialog box or the `addpath` function. Previous experience with MATLAB (R) or another programming language is required for appropriate use of these scripts.

### System requirements

| System requirements |                   |
| ----------          | :----------:      |
| Operating system    | > Windows 8.1     |
|                     | > Ubuntu 16.04    |
| Software            | MATLAB (R)        |
| Processor           | 2 GHz             |
| Memory (RAM)        | 2 GB              |
| Hard-drive space    | 50 MB             |

**Minimal system requirements for using these scripts.** This does not include hard-drive space required for additional software packages or dependencies.

### Dependencies
The following MATLAB (R) Toolboxes are required: Image Processing Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox, and Signal Processing Toolbox. Additional dependencies include [uTrack - Danuser lab](https://www.utsouthwestern.edu/labs/danuser/software/#utrack_anc), [Bioformat](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.9.2/users/matlab/), and MATLAB Central files where listed.
